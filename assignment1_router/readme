The project mainly consists of 4.cpp files and 4.h files and a makefile to run the program.
Router.cpp contains the code to extract file contents from circuit.txt which is C1, at the same time router.cpp also return the number of connection wires in the circuit.

a_project.cpp is used to locate the minimal path between source and target, I have explanation after each line, describing its purpose.

a_test.cpp is the code for tracing back to original source and marking the path.

example.cpp is the main function, all the functions are called in this file and all functions are included by a header file.

example is the executable file to draw the graphic, however, under linux environment the graphic cannot stay on the screen, during the testing phase, I use system("pause") in Visual studioto keep the graphic, thus, I call the delay function after drawing each line, this can make the graphic stay a little longer, but cannot stop it from disappearing, I will keep looking for other solutions on that issue. 

From the output window you can see information about the running process, the number before " about to start graphics" is the total length of connection.
